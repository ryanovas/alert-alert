		<p>As engineers, entrepreneurs, and most importantly, space enthusiasts, winning the NASA International Space Apps Challenge in the ‘Best Use of Data’ category is a dream come true. Equally, it was an honour representing Toronto and Canada on the international stage. </p>

		<p>When first conceptualizing SkyWatch we aimed to build a tool that simply ‘opened up the heavens’ to the 7 billion-plus here on Earth. As the product developed we began to realize an even greater potential - one that allowed children to witness spectacular events millions of light years away at the exact same time as NASA scientists, a privilege never before recognized.</p>

		<p>Moving forward there is still a lot of work that needs to be done to have SkyWatch live to its fullest potential. We are extending this opportunity to anyone out there who wishes to be a part of building something that is truly out of this world. If you feel as though you could contribute to the project, or you would like to learn more, do not hesitate to contact us at skywatch.co!</p>

		<p>Finally we want to thank the amazing Space Apps Toronto organizers for putting together such a great event; the judges for recognizing our hard work and potential; NASA for being NASA; and a very special thanks to NASA astrophysicist Scott Barthelmy whose  generosity in answering our inquiries was of a great help towards understanding and building the complex technology that helps power SkyWatch.</p>
